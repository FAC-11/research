# Accessibilty in Navigation and Modals

## Nav Bar Accessibility 
_Why do we need accessibile nav bars?_
* For user agents without CSS and JS 
* For users with sight problems 
* For users with difficulty seeing low contrast 
* To enable users without a mouse to access the navigation options with only key presses

_What do we need to do to make our nav bars accessible?_
* Use defined accessibility features such as tabindex 
* Name the nav bar options appropriately 
* Make sure the colour contrast is sufficient. Check your colour contrast ration [here](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* For modern menus eg. burger the user should have the ability to select option without a click press
