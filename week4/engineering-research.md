## Modules: 
### Questions:
Why is it a good idea to modularise your code? What are require and module.exports? Why can't you use them in the browser? How might you modularise client-side code?

## Asyncronous functions: 
### Questions:
Why should you use asyncronous forms of functions wherever possible in Node? What are error-first callbacks, and why is it important to follow that pattern in your own code? Why should you avoid using throw in callbacks? When might you use the syncronous form of a function instead?

## Input/output (the fs and path modules): 
### Questions:
What kind of tasks does the fs module enable you to perform that you wouldn't be able to in the browser? What are some of the issues of working with paths when accessing a file system? How does the path module help, and why should you use it instead of manually writing file paths as strings?

## Working with URLs (the url and querystring modules): 
### Questions:
What is a urlObject and how is it structured? Why is it important to be able to turn JavaScript objects into querystrings and back again? Why is it a bad idea to build a query string manually from other strings (think about URL encoding and escape characters)?
