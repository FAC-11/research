# Test Coverage
## What is test coverage?
*Test coverage* is a measure of how much of the code you've written is being executed by the your _testing framework_.

So if your test coverage is 100%, every line of your code is invoked when you are running your tests.

## Why is test coverage useful?
If you have code that isn't tested when you run your test framework, it can create several problems:

* untested code can behave in unexpected ways, creating *bugs*
* untested features can be difficult to maintain without making changes that *break the rest of the code*
* untested code, if it's not needed, can clutter a project and create more problems if you need to fix it later on

## What are Istanbul and nyc?

## How would you use them to improve your testing?

## Use Istanbul/nyc to calculate your code coverage for the TDD workshop.
See Aisha's demonstration!
